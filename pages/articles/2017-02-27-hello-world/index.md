Hello I wanted a new portfolio website so after 15 minutes of research into modern website generators I decided to make one using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). Other alternatives considered were [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/) and some other one that started with an A that I can't find anymore. I mainly picked Gatsby because it looked fairly popular and had nice example templates. I will make another post about the process of using Gatsby and setting it up for Github pages.
