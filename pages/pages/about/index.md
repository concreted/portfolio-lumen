I'm a software developer, currently at [Mira](https://www.getmira.com), formerly at [Minted](https://www.minted.com). I went to [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com) and have a film degree from UC Berkeley. I like movies, TV, comics, novels, short stories, plays, most music, tennis, car racing, rock climbing, yoga, running, playing guitar, drawing, video games, cats, and tea, among other things.
